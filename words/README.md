## Exercise

1. In code, get all the words within the [sample data](words.json) into an object or data structure that you can manipulate
2. Log the number of characters for every word within the "words" key in the sample data
3. Print an additional log for all words where the number of characters in the word is an odd number
4. Sort the resulting words from step 3 according to the number of characters in each of them, from least to greatest 
5. Please include a README.md on how we can run your code and tests.

## How to run the code
